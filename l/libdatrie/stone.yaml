summary     : datrie - Double-Array Trie Library
description : |
    Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method in which search time is independent of database size. It only takes O(m) search time, where m is the length of the search string. Comparably as efficient as hashing, trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as spelling dictionaries.
