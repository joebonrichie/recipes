summary     : Syntax highlighting engine for Kate syntax definitions
description : |
    This is a stand-alone implementation of the Kate syntax highlighting engine. It's meant as a building block for text editors as well as for simple highlighted text rendering (e.g. as HTML), supporting both integration with a custom editor as well as a ready-to-use QSyntaxHighlighter sub-class.
builddeps   :
    - binary(perl)
    # Temporary, boulder doesn't handle build ordering resolution correctly when builddeps are added by macros, so add ECM manually
    - cmake(ECM)
    - cmake(Qt6CorePrivate)
    - cmake(Qt6Qml)
    - cmake(Qt6Quick)
